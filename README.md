# Freelancer-rates

Instructions

In this exercise I wrote a code to help a freelancer communicate with their clients about the prices of certain projects. 

Task #1 Calculate the day rate given an hourly rate

A client contacts the freelancer to enquire about their rates. The freelancer explains that they work 8 hours a day. However, the freelancer knows only their hourly rates for the project. I helped them estimate a day rate given an hourly rate. The day rate does not need to be rounded or changed to a "fixed" precision.

Task #2 Calculate the number of workdays given a fixed budget

Another day, a project manager offers the freelancer to work on a project with a fixed budget. Given the fixed budget and the freelancer's hourly rate, I helped them calculate the number of days they would work until the budget is exhausted. The result was rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Task #3 Calculate the discounted rate for large projects

Often, the freelancer's clients hire them for projects spanning over multiple months. In these cases, the freelancer decides to offer a discount for every full month, and the remaining days are billed at day rate. Every month has 22 billable days. I helped them estimate their cost for such projects, given an hourly rate, the number of days the project spans, and a monthly discount rate. The discount is always passed as a number, where 42% becomes 0.42. The result must be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
